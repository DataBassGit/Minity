# Getting Started with Configurations

## Overview

Welcome to the central hub for system configurations. Below, you'll find specific areas of interest that dictate how the system behaves. Each section has dedicated documentation to provide in-depth insights.

### **Foundation:**

- **[Config Class](ConfigClass.md)**: The heart of configurations. Understand the class responsible for harmonizing the system's settings.

- **[Settings](../Settings/Settings.md)**: A deep dive into directives, memories, models, paths, and storage. Think of these as the fine-tuned engine settings that keep the system humming.

### **Advanced Customizations:**

- **[Agents Prompts](../Agents/AgentPrompts.md)**: Craft dynamic prompts to guide agent actions. 

- **[Custom Agents](../Agents/CustomAgents.md)**: Empower your system with tailor-made agents fitting specific needs.

- **[Personas](../Personas/Personas.md)**: Personas encapsulate knowledge accessible to agents, ranging from personality to any kind of general knowledge.

- **[Tools & Actions](../ToolsAndActions/Overview.md)**: The system's utility belt. Understand the tools available and how they can be choreographed into actionable sequences.

- **[Overriding LLM Defaults](../Settings/Models.md)**: Learn the flexibility of having agents override default LLM settings when needed.
