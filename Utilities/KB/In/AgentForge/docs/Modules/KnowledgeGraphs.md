# Knowledge Graphs in AgentForge

## Overview

Knowledge graphs play a crucial role in the **AgentForge** framework, serving as foundational structures that underpin intelligent decision-making and data interaction processes. They are pivotal in enhancing the contextual awareness and cognitive capabilities of agents and modules within the system.

## Integration with Modules

Several modules within **AgentForge** are specifically designed to interact with, enhance, and utilize knowledge graphs, ensuring that the system's intelligence is continually evolving and expanding:

- **[InjectKG Module](InjectKG.md)**: Facilitates the direct injection of structured knowledge into the knowledge graph, using insights extracted by the **[MetadataKGAgent](ModuleAgents/MetadataKGAgent.md)**. This process enriches the graph with detailed, contextual metadata, enabling more nuanced analyses and interactions.

- **[LearnDoc Module](LearnDoc.md)**: Engages in analyzing textual documents to extract and learn new information. This module not only enhances the knowledge graph through the **[LearnKGAgent](ModuleAgents/LearnKGAgent.md)** but also ensures that the newly acquired knowledge is systematically integrated via the **[InjectKG Module](InjectKG.md)**.

- **[Knowledge Traversal Module](KnowledgeTraversal.md)**: Specializes in sophisticated querying techniques to navigate and retrieve specific data points from the knowledge graph. This module exemplifies how deeply integrated knowledge structures can be effectively traversed to extract valuable insights.
